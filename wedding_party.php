				<span class="bold">Glyn Gracias</span>
				<p>
					Glyn Gracias has been my best friend since before we were born. When we got engaged, besides our families, she was the first person I called, and without hesitation, she gracias-ly (see what I did there) agreed to be my maid of honour. This summer, my smarty-pants friend will be moving to Vancouver this to go through the MBA program at the University of British Colombia.<br/>
					Unfortunately for me, as part of her program, she will be participating in a global study session while we are getting married (hence the “in spirit” part). But, even though she won't be standing right next to me on that day, I know that she always has and always will be supporting me from wherever she may be. And, I know that we still have a lifetime of milestones to celebrate together.

				<span class="bold">Lorraine D'Souza</span>
				<p>
					Lorraine D'Souza is my younger cousin, but I think of her as more of a younger sister. We grew up together in Toronto, and though life took us to different ends of the country (and for a while the world), we've still remained close. What I love most about Lo is her incredible zest for life. Her charismatic and positive personality just shines through as soon as she walks into the room, and people are instantly drawn to her - you'll see what I mean when you meet her.
					Lo just finished her Bachelor of Commerce from Ryerson University and is currently pursuing a career in Business Marketing.  I'm very grateful that she will be making the long trek across the country to come share this important day with Derek and I.

				<span class="bold">Bonnie Marr</span>
				<p>
					Do you have that one friend that seems to just get you? Bonnie is that friend for me. We are both from Calgary but met in Edmonton while living in residence. We became fast friends over our mutual love of food, TV and laughing at the most ridiculous things - we even have a special laugh together.<br/>
					I'm so thankful to have her as a part of our wedding, but more importantly as a part of my life.  And, while I can't believe it's been 10 years since we first met, I know that there are a million laughs in store for us. Bons is a grade 1 teacher, and just like many of her students, she is just cute as a button.

				<span class="bold">Lori Palasty</span>
				<p>
					If you could define kindness with a picture, it would be of Lori Palasty - which is probably why she became a nurse. We also met while living in residence through her boyfriend - now husband - Scott. Over the years our friendship developed into something so rare and special: one where you can talk about and share anything and everything without judgment and know that on the other end there is only support and love. I am so thankful for that. Almost two years ago, I had the honour to be a part of her wedding, and I'm thrilled that I she'll be standing next to me in February.<br/>
					She and Scott now live in Kamloops where Scott works as a dentist. They also live with their cute little furry baby Riley.
